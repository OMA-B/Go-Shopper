# Go-Shopper
Just a simple shopping list, more or less like a todo list...
Has quite some functionalities which you might find interesting...
I've arranged the files and codes in such a way that you wouldn't find difficulty navigating through or understanding...
But if get muzzled at any point, you can always reach out to me on any of my social medium(links' on my profile)...
I hope you like it, find it helpful/useful...
Would love to receive your feedback as well, so kindly reach out(as in no 5).
